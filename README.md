# NumVision
Artificial Intelligence for recognizing numbers

Pet Project. Creating an AI from scratch using numpy as an assistant.  
mnist collections train and test were used as training data.  
After **20 generations**, recognizes digits from **train** folder with **98.24%** probability,  
from **test** folder (without training of course) **96.18%**.

To use it, all you have to do is upload all the pictures you want into your folder,  
and then type it into the input string in the program, then AI to give you the answer.  
The *MyNums* folder is provided as an example

The link from where you can download the training data is https://github.com/pjreddie/mnist-csv-png.
