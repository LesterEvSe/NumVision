# NumVision
Artificial Intelligence for recognizing numbers

Pet Project. Creating an AI from scratch using numpy as an assistant.  
mnist collections train and test were used as training data.  
After **20 generations**, recognizes digits from **train** folder with **98.24%** probability,  
from **test** folder (without training of course) **96.18%**.

The link from where you can download the training data is https://github.com/pjreddie/mnist-csv-png.
